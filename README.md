### Klink

Recognizing that children learn through repetition and feedback, Klink is a collection of children games that uses Fabric JS to create and interactive canvas for children to learn how to read and write. Our collection of games can be connected to the Xbox 360 Kinect to allow users to play the games with a wave of a hand.
